## Overview
River bathymetry is important for accurate flood modelling but often unavailable due to the time-intensive and expensive nature of its acquisition. This leads to several proposed and implemented approaches for its estimation. However, the errors in measurements and estimations inherent in these methods, affecting the accuracy of the flood modelling outputs, are not extensively reserached. Hence, our research quantified this uncertainty using a Monte Carlo approach and flood model LISFLOOD-FP to generate multiple flood simulations for analysis. Validation of these simulations against observed flood levels reveals that inaccuracies in river bathymetry estimations can lead to significant deviations in flood predictions, underscoring the need for precise bathymetric data for reliable modeling.
