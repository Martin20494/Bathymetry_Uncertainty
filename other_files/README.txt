Four folders contain all figures for the paper:

- `all_results`: Contains other 7 folders:

	* `boxplots`: 3 boxplots for covMWDs, flood extents, and RMSEs. The script is stored here.

	* `formulas`: 3 scatter plots show the relationships between parameters and river bathymetries estimated by the UF and CMR formulas, and a script to generate these plots.
	
	* `observed_flood_level`: Two versions of observed flood debris. One is original (2005b) and the other is when predicted-dry-area debris was removed (2005t).

	*  `variations_in_covs`, `variations_in_depths`, and `variations_in_extents`: Maps of each dataset (among 8 datasets) and script to extract them from eight simulation folders.

	* `waikanae_river_characteristics_depths`: Parameters and Bathymetries and their simulations along the Waikanae River, and the script to plot them.

- `flow_tide`: Contains original flow and tide csv files with the plot and a script to generate this plot.

- `map`: Contains 2 QGIS files and the map generated from them.

- `simulation_process`: Contains 3 figures of parameter table, workflow, and eight-dataset table.
